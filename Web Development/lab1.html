        What to know about the 'beach towel revolt' taking back Greek beaches
    </h4>
    <p>Across Greece, locals are taking matters into their own hands by throwing their towels down to reclaim their beaches and
    access to nature – 
    
    without the hefty price tag.Even if you've never visited Greece, parts of this scene probably sound familiar. However, on this day, there were also
    a few unusual details. Three of the attendees were holding up a huge sign saying, "Reclaim the Beach". A man with a
    loudspeaker stood next to them. As the audience watched, he read parts of the Greek constitution aloud, which states
    that beaches and other natural areas belong to the country's citizens.</p>

    <h4>
        How female Fauvists were some of history's most audacious painters
    </h4>
    <p>
        She almost always wore black, but in Woman with a Hat (1905) so many colours swirl around the canvas that Amélie
        Matisse's dress is an indeterminate shade. She was a brunette, but her hair is a streak of fiery red paint, and her nose
        and forehead are green.
        
        Putting the wind up the snooty Paris art scene at the Salon d'Automne of 1905, works such as this one with their noisy,
        unnaturalistic colours and childish flattened forms were dubbed "Fauves" (wild beasts) by a critic − and the name stuck.
        Building on the work of Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh, Fauvism's untamed art freed colour from a uniquely
        descriptive, imitative function. Colour was now communicating emotion and its delineated planes prepared the way for the
        fractured geometry of cubism and the dawn of abstract art.
