Practice Task 4: Twist your algorithm in Practice Task 1 to work for minima set of points
instead of maxima points.


We need to change the comparison condition when iterating through the points.
Instead of keeping points that have higher y and z coordinates than the top of the stack,
we'll keep points that have lower y and z coordinates.

While the stack is not empty and the y and z coordinates of the current point are less than or equal to the top of the stack,
pop from the stack.
