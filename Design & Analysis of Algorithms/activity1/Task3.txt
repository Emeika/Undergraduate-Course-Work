Practice Task 3:  How will your algorithm behave if all the points lie on the same line
vertically or horizontally? Will it effect the total number of iterations of your loops? How?
Justify in couple of lines.


Horizontal Line: If all points lie on the same horizontal line, the y-coordinate will remain constant.

Vertical Line: If all points lie on the same vertical line, the x-coordinate will remain constant. 

In the case where all points lie on the same line (either vertically or horizontally), 
the algorithm will iterate through all the points, and each point will be dominated by the last point 
in the sorted order (which will have the highest y and z coordinates in a horizontal line or the highest x coordinate in a vertical line).
Hence, only the outer most points will be considered a local maxima.

This scenario does not affect the total number of iterations since the number of points remains the same, 
since both y and z needs to be dominated.
