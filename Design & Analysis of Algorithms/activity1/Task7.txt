Practice Task 7: How maxima-point algorithm will behave if multiple points have same
value of x-component? E.g. (2,9),(2,5),(2,4),(2,1). What needs to be fixed in the algorithm to
handle this boundary case? Geometric Approach.

sorting must be done on y coordinates in descending order
the primary comparison criterion during iteration will be y
