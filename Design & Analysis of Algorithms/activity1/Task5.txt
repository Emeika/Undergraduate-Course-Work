Practice Task 5: How will your algorithm behave if all the points lie on on left sliding
diagonal? Will it effect the total number of iterations of your loops? How? Justify in couple
of lines

eg:
for points [(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3, 3), (4, 4, 4)]
the maxima will be (4, 4, 4)
the minima will be (1, 1, 1)


If all points lie on a left-sliding diagonal, the algorithm will iterate through each point, 
comparing their y and z coordinates. In this diagonal scenario, each point will have a unique y and z coordinate.
However, the point with the highest/lowest x, y, and z coordinates will be the only one left 
in the stack, as it won't be dominated by any other point. 
The total number of iterations remains unaffected
