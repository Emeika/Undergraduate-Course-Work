"""
Design an algorithm for the maxima point problem (as discussed in class) 
for a point in 3-D space i.e. a point having its x, y & z components.

########################### solved by geometric approach  ################################
"""
Input: A set of points in 3D space with x, y, and z components.
Output: List of local maxima points.

Procedure:
Sort the points based on x coordinates in ascending order
A stack will store the maxima points
(Stack is more efficient because we dont need to randomly access our point indexes)

As soon as the point Pi is dominated by Pj, we do not need Pi point, because Pi can never be a maxima point.
A vertical plane is sweeped across the 3D space along vertical plane
when it reaches the rightmost point

O(nlogn) time complexity
O(n) for sorting  + O(n) outer loop  + O(n) inner loop
